# P3-Score
P3-Score is a software for evaluating protein-ligand binding affinity.
# how to use？
First, the normal operation of P3-Score needs to be based on X-Score.Therefore, please download X-Score first and make sure it works properly.You can try the following code："xscore --score protein_file.pdb ligand_file.mol2".
Second, requires python3 to be available on your device.You can try the following code："python".
Finally, you can try running P3-Score.You can try the following code："python P3-Score_predict.py --p protein_file.pdb --l ligand_file.pdb".You can learn more details by looking at the python documentation.
# download
The P3-Score_predict.py file can be downloaded and used directly.But please do not reprint or use in other ways.Thank you!
